# R3. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) Reference

## Breaking it down, step by step
**Step 1**: What is convolution? It's short for "kernel convolution." This was invented to do image filters, like blurring and other effects. Here's how it works, as explained by Dr Mike Pound:

**Step 2**: So what is deep learning? and what makes it different than non-deep neural nets? Brais Martinez explains. He doesn't talk about images, but house prices!

**Step 3**: Putting it together, how deep-learning CNNs are really changing the game, back with Mike Pound. Focuses on moving the data from the shape of in image, to using the kernel convolution to extract features, and doing that enough to get a single array of features that we call the logits vector.

##  From the top, this time with feeling
This video is another approach to showing all the pieces fitting together to create a neural net that can categorize MNIST data. I don't recommend the rest of the this series, but this one piece is perfectly relevant for us.
