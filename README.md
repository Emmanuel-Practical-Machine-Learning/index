# Practical Machine Learning
A Course in AI for non-majors, developed at Emmanuel College

LEARNING OBJECTIVES: 


•  Understand  basic  operating  theory  of 
multiple AI techniques, including Neural  Networks,  Transfer 
Learning,  Clustering,  Recurrent Neural 
Networks,  Convolutional  Neural 
Networks,  Generative  Models, 
Generative  Adversarial  Networks,  and 
Reinforcement Learning. 

• Learn how to assess AI systems for bias in 
data, learning, and implementation, and 
critique existing systems for inequity. 

• Understand societal impacts of bias in artificial intelligence and machine learning

• Learn current known methods of attack 
against AI systems, primarily adversarial 
AI  attacks  which  “fool”  systems  into 
producing incorrect results.
